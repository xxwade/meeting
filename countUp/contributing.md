Whoa, if you've made it this far you must be committed to helping out!

## Development
### Build System
GULP! Yes we use [Gulp][2] and yes we love [Node.js][0]. If you haven't installed Node & [Npm][1] please go ahead and do so. ... Great! You must be all setup with Node & Npm. Go ahead and clone down the repo. Once the repo is cloned down, enter the directory and run `npm install`. While we wait know this, after all the node modules have installed you are ready to start development. To build countUp run `gulp build`, to clean the `dist` directory run `gulp clean`. If you're lazy run `gulp` and it will clean and then build countUp.

Please remember:
- Clean commit messages.
- Fork and then create a feature branch. Then create pull request into [inorganik/countUp.js/tree/master][3].
- Re-build countUp and include it in your pull request.
- We aren't switching to Grunt, so don't suggest it.
- countUp.js probably should be inside a `lib` directory, but meh.

#### TLDR;
Deps: [Node.js][0] w/[Npm][1]

Run `npm install`. Use `gulp` to clean and build countUp.
